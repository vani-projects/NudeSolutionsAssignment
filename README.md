.NET Based Angular Application

This is a .NET based Angular application. The Angular front end application uses the Restful web services exposed by the ASP.NET Web API app that provides CRUD operations for the content items. The categories of these items is a static list. The items however are backed by an SQL database, so the saved quotation of contents is persisted across application restarts.
